# A Python Primer ("Prymer")

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the on-campus version of CSE 6040: Computing for Data Analysis. These materials were adapted from [Jake VanderPlas's "Whirlwind Tour of Python"](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/).

> A good starting point is [`index.ipynb`](./index.ipynb). You'll find some exercises in [`exercises`](./exercises).
>
> The quick "live preview" demo we did in the first few minutes of the class is available [here](./live-demos/dummy_live_demo_0_2019_08_19.ipynb).
